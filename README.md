# Stock-Analysis
Stock Analysis Module 2 VBA GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp
## Overview of Project
VBA is a powerful analytical tool  often used in the financial industry, among others, to analyze and adjust big amounts of data, create portfolios, forecast sales and profits and generate financial risks. In this project we are applying VBA functionality to help Steve analyze a dataset that includes stock market prices of the year 2017 and 2018 with the purpose of generating  insights that can influence Steve’s parents decisions and accomplish their goal of investing at a lower cost and getting higher returns. 

To achieve this goal we are going to run a line of code throughout our dataset to find  the total daily volume and yearly return of each stock.  In the past we helped Steve’s parents to draw information from this same dataset. The same process that was used back then will be applied to this new project.This process is called refactoring  which means  that the same code will be applied but only small changes will be made to the code in order to make it more efficient and fast since that dataset contains more information than the data that was previously analyzed. 

Using the same line of code is very helpful and convenient when data needs to be pulled over time, which is beneficial for Steve’s parents in case they want to keep track of the stock market in the future.  


## Results(include screenshots)
Investing in the stock market comes with risks but a good strategy to avoid financial loss is monitoring the market  and VBA has helped Steve to do so by tracking stocks performance and  predicting their future direction.
